## Running Typora on Chromebook/Linux

![Typora logo](/assets/img/typora-logo.jpg "Typora logo")

I am a power user, but I am also a minimalist. I don't like bloated software because simplicity is key. That's the UNIX philosophy. I discovered that the best way to take notes and write simple papers or blog entries was to use Markdown. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents, a simpler version of the powerful LaTeX. I actually "discovered" Markdown while using GitHub and writing a few `README.md` files. It was love at first *write*.

This is where Typora comes in. It is the **THE MOST** polished Markdown editor available anywhere and runs on all major platforms (Windows, MacOS, and Linux).

>Typora gives you a seamless experience as both a reader and a writer. It removes the preview window, mode switcher, syntax symbols of markdown source code, and all other unnecessary distractions. Instead, it provides a real live preview feature to help you concentrate on the content itself.

Typora is based on GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) with many additional functionalities such as real live preview, shortcut keys, and math blocks to name a few. Let's get on with the show!

## Installation

Install Typora public key by running:

```
wget -qO - https://typora.io/linux/public-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

Add Typora's repository:

```
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://typora.io/linux ./'
sudo apt-get update
```

Install typora:

```
sudo apt-get install typora
```

Run Typora. If you get any of the graphics acceleration errors below:

AMD Graphics:

```
ERROR:gbm_wrapper.cc(255)] Failed to export buffer to dma_buf: No such file or directory (2)
```

Intel Graphics:

```
MESA-INTEL: warning:  Performance support disabled, consider sysctl dev.i915.perf_stream_paranoid=0
libva error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/iHD_drv_video.so init failed
```

Try launching `typora` with extra arguments `--disable-gpu`.

It should be pointed out that when installed in wattOS R13 Linux distribution (based on Debian 12 Bookworm) or ChromeOS, there is an application shortcut available which you can easily put in your application shelf/bar. This avoids the annoying warning messages from appearing in a terminal console.

## Add printing capability:

```
sudo apt-get -y install cups
sudo apt-get -y install cups-pdf 
```

add pdf printer to cups 

- named files end up in ~/PDF/
- unnamed files are stored in /var/spool/cups-pdf/ANONYMOUS/

```
sudo lpadmin -p cups-pdf -v cups-pdf:/ -E -P /usr/share/ppd/cups-pdf/CUPS-PDF_opt.ppd 
```

Check success

```
lpstat -t 
```

List printers and whcih one is the default printer

```
lpstat -p -d 
```

Print file to named printer (check in ~/PDF for testfile.pdf)

```
lp -d PDF testfile.txt
```
