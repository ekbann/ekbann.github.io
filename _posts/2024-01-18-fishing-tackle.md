### Useful Knowledge for Simple Fishing

![Jekyll-MathJax logo](/assets/img/fishing.png "Fishing logo")

- **Ultra-light** (UL) tackle for trout/bass/panfish (< 8 lbs): 6'6", 2-6 lbs, < 1/4 oz, 1000 reel, gear ratio 4.9-6.2:1
- Minimum tackle for **in-shore saltwater** (upper end of UL): 6'6" (4.4 - 13.2 lbs) rod with a 2000 reel and 10 lbs braid main (or 7'/2500/15 lbs combo).
- **Uni-knot** is an *universal knot* for hook, spool, and swivel/snap (girador). Thick lines use 3 loops, medium 4, and light 6.
- **Double Uni-knot** can be used to join mono to mono or mono to braid. Use 5 turns for mono and 10 turns for braid.
- **Max drag** should be 25%-33% of line strength.
- The biggest thing is you **NEVER** want to be reeling in while your drag is being pulled. This does not gain any line or add tension to the fish, *it only twists your line*. So either stop reeling and let the fish run, or tighten the drag then reel.
- The **weight** (or **power**) rating of a fishing pole refers to its resistance to bending. In other words, a light rod is less stiff, and therefore bends more easily than a heavy one.
- **Action** describes where that deflection (bending) takes place along the rod's length. A fishing rod is most powerful in its butt section, and that power diminishes incrementally the closer you move towards the tip.
- The “**action**” of a rod is determined by where a rod flexes along the blank. Faster action rods flex mostly near the tip. Moderate action rods flex more near the middle of the blank. Slower action rods flex down into the butt section.

Rod Action:

- **Extra Fast** action rods offer a high degree of tip sensitivity and offer faster power during hook set.  While it can be used in a variety of fishing situations, it is most popular with single hooks applications like worming and jigging.
- **Fast** action rods are *a great choice when you want a rod for all fishing applications*. This is because it is a healthy balance of fast tip and sensitivity, while still providing some forgiving power for a softer hook set.
- **Moderate** action rods you trade a little less sensitivity for a little more casting range. These are great rods for treble hook applications like crankbaits because the lighter action on hook set keeps the lure in the fish’s mouth.
- **Slow** action rods bend most of the way down, and have become much less popular in today’s fishing applications due to the technology advances in rod design – but ultra-light and some fly fishing applications still utilize these soft rods.

Making Sense of **rod rating**, **line strength**, and **reel max drag**:

- First, start with the rod, e.g. 6-12#.
- Second, define a middle poundage for the line, i.e. 9# so that the line will break before the rod.
- Lastly, set the reel drag to 3# which is 1/3 of line breaking.
- Remember that drag starts to increase as line is being released.
- This setup will give a good bend on the rod safely within the rating when loaded, i.e. the angle between rod and line is *obtuse*.
- It is ideal that you want the line to break before the rod, but if using heavier line than the rod rating, it is **very important** to set the drag to **LESS** than the rod rating. This will cause the fish to pull drag instead of forcing and possibly breaking the rod.
- So, when choosing a reel, pick one who's max drag is less that the rod's maximum line weight. Anything bigger will just be bulkier and heavier and not used to its maximum potential.
