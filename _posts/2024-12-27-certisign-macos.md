## How-To

If you never installed `DesktopID` before, start from step 3.

1. Uninstall `DesktopID` (drag to Trash).
2. Delete residual files from the directories:
3. 
```
~/Library/Application Support 
/Library/Application Support 
```
And drag them to the trash.

3. Re-install `DesktopID` and run it.
4. Configure your computer using `remoteID` instead of `mobileID`.
5. Use your `remoteID` login credentials.

Sign using the `e-CPF` PIN and OTP (one-time passcode, e-Token from the `remoteID` iOS app.)
