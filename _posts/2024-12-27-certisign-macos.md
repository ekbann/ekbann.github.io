## How-To

If you never installed `DesktopID` before, start from step 3.

1. Uninstall `DesktopID` (drag to Trash).
2. Delete residual files from the directories:
```
~/Library/Application Support 
/Library/Application Support 
```
And drag them to the trash.

3. Reinstall `DesktopID` and run.
4. Configure using `remoteID` instead of `mobileID`.
5. Use your `remoteID` login credentials.

Sign using the e-CPF PIN and OTP (one-time passcode) from the `remoteID e-Token` iOS app.
